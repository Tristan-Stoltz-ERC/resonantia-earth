   - $12B investment
   - Innovation sanctuary

4. **Churchill Aurora, Canada** (Years 4-7)
   - 1.5 GW hydro + wind
   - 600,000 population
   - $25B investment
   - Arctic gateway, data centers

5. **Kerinci Spaceport, Indonesia** (Years 5-8)

   - 2 GW hydro
   - 800,000 population
   - $33B investment
   - Sovereign wealth experiment

## Key Economic Model

### Energy Arbitrage Strategy
1. **Identify** locations with <$0.02/kWh renewable energy
2. **Build** energy infrastructure first (immediate revenue)
3. **Attract** energy-intensive industries (data centers, aluminum, hydrogen)
4. **Grow** the city using energy revenues
5. **Export** the model globally

### Financial Projections
- **Total Investment**: $145B over 10 years
- **Population**: 5.25 million people
- **Energy Capacity**: 10.5 GW renewable
- **Annual Revenue** (Year 10): $40B+
- **IRR**: 15-20% for investors
- **Payback Period**: 5-7 years

## Indonesia Spaceport Analysis (As Requested)

### Standalone Geothermal
- 300 MW capacity
- $3.4B investment
- $150M annual revenue
- 10.2% IRR

### With Spaceport Addition
- Same geothermal base
- $38B total investment
- $2B+ annual revenue at maturity
- **18.5% IRR** (energy funds space development)
